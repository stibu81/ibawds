ibawds provides useful functions and datasets for the [Data Science
course at
IBAW](https://ibaw.ch/bildungsangebote/informatik/coding-data-science/data-science-ndk-hf/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of ibawds from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ibawds) with:

``` r
install.packages("ibawds")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stibu81/ibawds")
```

## Setting up for the course

### Install R

Windows and Mac Users can download the installer for their operating
system from <https://cran.r-project.org/>. For Windows, installation
should be possible also for non-admin users. Mac users may also need to
install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).

Linux users find instructions for installation under Debian,
Fedora/Redhat, and Ubuntu under the same link. Note that the official
package sources may contain an outdated version of R, but usually the
current version can be installed from some other source. Make sure that
you install version 4.0 or newer.

### Install RStudio

We will use RStudio as our
[IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
in the course. You can download it from this
[link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Usually, it is
easiest to use the installer for your operating system. However, if you
don‚Äôt have admin access on your computer, you should instead download
the appropriate zip-file / tarball. Under Windows, extract the zip-file
to a folder where you have write access. The executable file is located
under `bin/rstudio.exe`.

When you run RStudio for the first time, you have to select the R
version that you want to use. Usually, the dialogue box should list
available R versions for you to choose. If not, click on ‚ÄúBrowse‚Ä¶‚Äù and
navigate to the folder where you installed R.

### Install R Packages

We will use a variety of R Packages during the course. To set them up,
first install ibawds with

``` r
install.packages("ibawds")
```

and then run the following to install additional packages:

``` r
library(ibawds)
install_ibawds()
```

You will be asked to install missing packages. Confirm to install them.
Note that this may take more than 30 minutes depending on your system
and configuration.

### Check the Setup

In order to check that everything is set up correctly for the course,
run the following command:

``` r
check_ibawds_setup()
```

The function verifies that

- R and RStudio are up to date,
- the ibawds package is up to date, and
- all the required packages are installed

The function must be run from RStudio in order to run properly. If
everything is set up correctly, you will see a message that confirms
that your system is ready for the course similar to this one:

    ‚Ñπ Checking the setup for the course ...
    ‚Ñπ Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
    ‚úî R is up to date: 4.2.2
    ‚úî RStudio is up to date: 2023.6.1.524
    ‚úî All the required packages are installed.
    ‚úî ibawds is up to date: 1.0.0
    ‚úî üéâ Your system is ready for the course! üéâ

If not, the function will inform you about the steps that are needed to
fix the remaining issues. Rerun `check_ibawds_setup()` after performing
those steps to verify that your system is now ready.
