#' Dataset mtcars without row names
#'
#' In the [`mtcars`] dataset, the names of the car models are
#' stored as row names. However, when working with `ggplot2` and other
#' packages from the `tidyverse`, it is convenient to have all data in columns.
#' `mtcars2` is a variant of `mtcars` that contains car models in a column
#' instead of storing them as row names.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 32 rows and 12 variables. The format is identical
#'  to [`mtcars`] and details can be found in its documentation. The only difference
#'  is that the car model names are stored in the column `model` instead of
#'  row names.
